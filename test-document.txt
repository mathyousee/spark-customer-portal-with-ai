This is a test document to demonstrate the AI-powered document summarization feature. 

Key Points:
- The system can now extract actual text from uploaded documents
- Supported formats include PDF, Word documents, Excel files, CSV files, and plain text
- The extracted text is sent to Azure OpenAI for intelligent summarization
- Real-time processing provides accurate summaries of document content

Technical Implementation:
The application uses specialized libraries for text extraction:
- PDF.js for PDF documents
- Mammoth.js for Word documents  
- SheetJS (XLSX) for Excel and CSV files
- FileReader API for plain text files

This enhanced functionality provides users with genuine AI-powered insights into their document content, making it easier to quickly understand large amounts of text without reading the entire document.

Benefits:
1. Time-saving document analysis
2. Key point extraction
3. Intelligent content summarization
4. Support for multiple file formats
5. Real Azure OpenAI integration

The system is now ready for production use with proper Azure OpenAI configuration.
